None,"State- and condition-dependent risk taking: Food restriction shifts boldness, exploration, and refuge use in juvenile guppies (Poecilia reticulata)","Background: Nutrition and body condition can generate state-dependent decision rules that shape consistent individual differences (personality) in the wild. We tested how dietary manipulation alters boldness, exploration, neophobia/neophilia, and risk-taking under predation threat in a small fish. Methods: Juvenile guppies were assigned to High-ration (enriched calories) or Low-ration (food restriction) treatments for 21 days to manipulate body state. We quantified boldness (latency to emerge from a refuge), exploratory tendency (open-field path length and space use), neophobia/neophilia (time spent interacting with a novel object), and risk under predation (refuge use and foraging latency with predator odor). Each fish was assayed repeatedly across contexts to estimate repeatability and cross-context behavioral syndromes. Results: Low-ration (hungry; lower body condition) individuals were bolder (−21% emergence latency), more exploratory (+18% path length), and more neophilic (+27% novel-object interactions) than High-ration fish. Under predator odor, all fish increased refuge use, but Low-ration fish still accepted higher risk (−15% foraging latency at the food patch). Individual differences were repeatable (R=0.31–0.46) and formed a boldness–exploration syndrome that persisted across nutritional states. Effects scaled with body condition index, indicating condition-dependent plasticity consistent with state-dependent foraging rules rather than strict asset-protection; individuals with lower residual reproductive value under restriction prioritized immediate caloric gain despite predation risk. Conclusions: Diet/food availability manipulations causally shift risk-taking and novelty responses while retaining underlying behavioral syndromes, highlighting how nutritional state and body condition shape animal personality and decision-making in risky, predator-exposed environments.",1,"Matches all query facets: explicit manipulation of diet/food availability (nutrition, caloric restriction), focus on body state/condition and residual reproductive value, assays of boldness, exploration, neophobia/neophilia, predation/refuge use (risk*) in an animal model, and tests of personality/behavioral syndrome with repeatability across contexts."
None,"Diet quality and adolescent risk-taking: A longitudinal study of nutrition, novelty seeking, and hazardous behaviors in secondary school students","Objective: To examine whether diet quality and perceived hunger are associated with risk-taking behaviors in humans. Methods: In a 2-year cohort of 2,184 adolescents (ages 12–16), we assessed diet quality (24-h recalls; Healthy Eating Index), food insecurity (household hunger scale), and personality (Big Five, novelty seeking/impulsivity) alongside self-reported risk-taking behaviors (dangerous driving, substance use, and delinquency). Exploratory behavior toward novel experiences (club/sport participation and new online trends) was tracked quarterly. Multilevel models tested whether baseline nutrition and changes in dietary restriction/deprivation predicted subsequent risk-taking, controlling for socioeconomic status and school effects. Results: Lower diet quality and intermittent dietary restriction were prospectively associated with greater novelty seeking and higher odds of substance use and hazardous behaviors over time (ORs 1.12–1.28 per SD). Associations were partially mediated by impulsivity but not by general psychopathology. No interactions with sex were observed. Conclusions: Among adolescents, poorer nutrition and periods of dietary deprivation prospectively relate to higher novelty seeking and self-reported risk-taking. While these findings link diet to behavioral outcomes, the study involves humans, survey-based outcomes, and social risks rather than animal boldness under predation or refuge use. It does not measure animal personality, phenotypic plasticity, or predator-related risk decisions following experimental diet manipulations.",0,"Will be captured by the search terms (diet/diet quality/restriction/deprivation; risk-taking; novelty/novelty seeking; personality) but is outside scope: human adolescents, self-reported social risk behaviors, no animal model, no predation/refuge context, no experimental manipulation of food availability to test animal boldness/exploration or behavioral syndromes."
