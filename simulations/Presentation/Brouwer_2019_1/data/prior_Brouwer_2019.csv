None,Cognitive Biases and Their Role in the Recurrence of Depressive Disorders: A Comprehensive Study,"This study explores the impact of cognitive biases on the recurrence of depressive disorders. We conducted a systematic review of existing literature, focusing on how maladaptive thought patterns, such as rumination and negative self-referential thinking, contribute to the risk of relapse in individuals diagnosed with depression. Our findings suggest that cognitive interventions targeting these biases may significantly reduce the likelihood of recurrence, highlighting the importance of cognitive therapy in managing depressive disorders. The implications for clinical practice and future research directions are discussed.",1,"The title and abstract directly address the relationship between cognitive theories and the recurrence of depression, aligning perfectly with the search terms provided."
