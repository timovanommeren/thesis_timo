"","Population Pharmacokinetics and Exposure–Response of Emicizumab (ACE-910/Hemlibra) in Adults and Adolescents with Hemophilia A: A Multicenter Nonlinear Mixed-Effects Analysis","Background: Emicizumab (ACE-910; RO5534262) is a subcutaneous bispecific monoclonal antibody for prophylaxis in hemophilia A. Comprehensive human pharmacokinetic (PK) characterization across dosing regimens is essential for optimization. Objectives: Quantify emicizumab PK parameters (clearance, volume of distribution, half-life, bioavailability, AUC) and assess exposure–bleed reduction relationships in persons with and without factor VIII inhibitors. Methods: In this multicenter analysis, 286 participants (≥12 years) received loading 3 mg/kg weekly ×4 then maintenance (1.5 mg/kg weekly, 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks, or 6 mg/kg every 4 weeks). Plasma concentrations were quantified by validated assays and analyzed via nonlinear mixed-effects modeling. Covariates included body weight, age, anti-drug antibodies. Exposure–response related steady-state AUC and trough concentrations to annualized treated bleed rate (ABR). Results: A two-compartment model with first-order absorption and linear elimination fit the data. Typical values: apparent clearance 0.0067 L/h, central volume 3.1 L, absorption rate 0.20 h−1, bioavailability 0.84; terminal half-life 27.8 days. Body weight affected clearance and volume; inhibitor status and age had no clinically relevant effect after weight normalization. Predicted steady-state exposures were comparable across approved schedules for equivalent monthly dose; higher exposure correlated with lower ABR. Conclusions: Emicizumab shows low clearance, limited distribution, and a long half-life supporting weekly to every-4-week administration. Population PK and exposure–response results support weight-based dosing with similar prophylactic efficacy across regimens.","1"
"","Pharmacokinetic Interaction Modeling of Recombinant Factor VIII During Concomitant Emicizumab Prophylaxis: A Simulation Study of Distribution and Clearance Profiles","Background: Patients on emicizumab prophylaxis may require episodic recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII). Understanding rFVIII pharmacokinetics (PK) during emicizumab therapy informs peri-procedural management. Objectives: Characterize rFVIII PK parameters (AUC, clearance, half-life, plasma levels) during concomitant emicizumab and explore dose–response implications for hemostasis. Methods: A two-compartment PK model for intravenous rFVIII with first-order elimination was simulated in virtual adults (n=1,000) at emicizumab steady state. Emicizumab effects were incorporated only in a pharmacodynamic cofactor-activity module; rFVIII ADME was unchanged. Outputs included rFVIII concentration–time profiles, AUC, and time above activity targets. Results: rFVIII PK (clearance, volume, terminal half-life) was unchanged by simulated emicizumab exposure; differences in bleeding risk arose from pharmacodynamic interaction rather than rFVIII drug kinetics. Lower rFVIII doses achieved target activity with emicizumab. Conclusions: Emicizumab improves coagulation activity without altering rFVIII PK in the model. Dosing adjustments should follow pharmacodynamic goals, not changes in rFVIII ADME.","0"
