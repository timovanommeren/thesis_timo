Methods: Adult C57BL/6J mice (n=72; 1:1 sex ratio) were habituated and tested in a counterbalanced OIC paradigm using two distinct contexts (visual/tactile/olfactory) and four neutral objects. Mice received CORT (2.5, 5, or 10 mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle immediately after the OIC sample phase. Memory was assessed 24 h later by discrimination index (DI) for the object whose identity was incongruent with the test context. Control NOR (separate cohort, n=36) was run with identical handling and delays. Results: Vehicle groups showed robust OIC memory (DI=0.32±0.05, p<0.001). CORT produced dose-dependent OIC impairment (5 mg/kg: DI=0.11±0.06, p=0.041; 10 mg/kg: DI=0.01±0.05, p=0.003 vs vehicle) with intact total exploration and locomotion. NOR was unaffected at all doses (all p>0.20). Context counterbalancing and object preference checks showed no baseline bias. Conclusions: Post-encoding glucocorticoid elevation selectively disrupts the binding of object and contextual information in mice, consistent with a specific vulnerability of episodic-like memory supported by hippocampal–parahippocampal networks. The OIC task provides a sensitive rodent assay for context–item association that complements—but is dissociable from—NOR.","1"

Here we evaluate a contextual fear-conditioning (CFC) variant in which freestanding objects constitute the contextual features. Methods: Adult Sprague–Dawley rats (n=48) underwent CFC in chambers containing two large objects (A,B) that defined the training context. Animals received three 0.7 mA footshocks paired with object-defined context exposure. Twenty-four hours later, freezing was tested either in the same object context (A,B) or in a rearranged “mismatch” context (A,C). Additional discrimination and spatial learning controls (T-maze) were included. Results: Rats froze more in the training object context than in the rearranged context (p<0.001), indicating context discrimination when objects serve as contextual cues. However, performance depended on shock pairing; sham-shocked controls showed minimal freezing regardless of object arrangement. Conclusions: Using objects to define a context supports CFC, but this reinforcement-based paradigm differs from spontaneous OIC recognition memory tasks that assess non-reinforced exploration of an object–context mismatch. Care is warranted when generalizing findings from object-defined CFC to episodic-like recognition assays.","0"
