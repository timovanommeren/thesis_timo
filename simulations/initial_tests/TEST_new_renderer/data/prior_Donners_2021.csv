,Population Pharmacokinetics of Emicizumab and Exposure–Response for Bleeding Outcomes in Adolescents and Adults with Hemophilia A: A Multicenter Prospective Cohort,"Background: Emicizumab, a subcutaneous bispecific antibody that bridges FIXa and FX, provides prophylaxis in hemophilia A. Quantifying human pharmacokinetics (PK) and linking exposure to clinical efficacy can guide dosing across body sizes and dosing intervals.
Methods: We conducted a multicenter, prospective cohort of 318 patients aged ?12 years with severe hemophilia A (with or without inhibitors) initiating emicizumab (3 mg/kg weekly ×4, then 1.5 mg/kg weekly, 3 mg/kg q2w, or 6 mg/kg q4w per clinician choice). Sparse PK sampling was performed at weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, and quarterly to 52 weeks. Total emicizumab concentrations were quantified by validated ELISA. Nonlinear mixed-effects modeling characterized population PK and covariate effects. Exposure metrics (Ctrough, average concentration [Cavg], and AUC?) were related to annualized treated bleeding rate (ABR) via negative binomial models adjusted for inhibitor status and prior bleed history.
Results: A two-compartment model with first-order absorption best described PK; typical clearance was 0.23 L/day (CV 28%) and central volume 3.0 L (CV 32%). Body weight and anti-drug antibodies (ADA; 2.5% transient, 0.6% persistent) were significant covariates on clearance. Median time to near–steady state was 8–9 weeks. Higher exposure associated with lower ABR: patients with Ctrough ?30 µg/mL had an adjusted ABR 0.8 (95% CI, 0.6–1.1) versus 2.1 (1.6–2.7) when Ctrough <30 µg/mL (rate ratio 0.38; p<0.001). Similar trends were observed for spontaneous joint bleeds. Safety was consistent with known profiles; no thrombotic microangiopathy occurred.
Conclusions: In humans, emicizumab exhibits low clearance and long half-life, achieving steady state by ~8 weeks. Exposure is strongly and independently associated with bleeding reduction, supporting individualized dosing in patients with low exposure (e.g., higher body weight or ADA).",1
,Cost-Effectiveness of Emicizumab Prophylaxis Versus Extended Half-Life Factor VIII for Severe Hemophilia A: A Dutch Healthcare Payer Perspective,"Background: While emicizumab has transformed hemophilia A management, its budget impact relative to extended half-life factor VIII (EHL-FVIII) remains debated.
Methods: A Markov cohort model simulated lifetime outcomes for males with severe hemophilia A without inhibitors in the Netherlands, comparing emicizumab prophylaxis to EHL-FVIII. Health states captured bleed frequency strata and arthropathy progression. Inputs included drug acquisition/administration costs, utilities, and non-drug medical costs; outcomes were incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per QALY gained. Scenario and probabilistic sensitivity analyses explored uncertainty.
Results: Emicizumab increased QALYs by 0.62 at an incremental lifetime cost of €185,000, yielding an ICER of €298,000/QALY. Results were most sensitive to drug price and assumed bleed reductions; price discounts ?35% made emicizumab cost-effective at a €80,000/QALY threshold.
Conclusions: From a payer perspective, emicizumab may not be cost-effective versus EHL-FVIII at current prices for patients without inhibitors, though price reductions could change this conclusion. These findings inform reimbursement policy.",0
